# Installing RFOptimization dependencies

RFO orchestrates three separate model processes. Use separate Python
environments for Foundry/RF3, Boltz, and upstream MPNN so their dependency
versions can differ. No containers, weights, or Baker Lab filesystem paths
are supplied or assumed.

## 1. Foundry and the driver

From the root of this Foundry checkout, with Python 3.12 or newer:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[rf3,rfo]'
foundry install rf3
export RF3_CKPT="$HOME/.foundry/checkpoints/rf3_foundry_01_24_latest_remapped.ckpt"
```

RFO requires a confidence-enabled RF3 checkpoint with its `train_cfg`.
Use `RF3_CKPT` to select a checkpoint explicitly. The command above uses
Foundry's public registry; historical RFO research configurations used
other checkpoints, so matching their results requires the corresponding
checkpoint and experiment settings. Full RF3 inference needs the AtomWorks
resources described in the [RF3 README](../../rf3/README.md).

When the driver runs in the RF3 environment, no `RF3_PYTHON` is needed.
Otherwise set it to that environment's absolute Python path:

```bash
export RF3_PYTHON=/path/to/foundry-env/bin/python
```

To run only the lightweight source driver in a different environment:

```bash
python -m pip install numpy biopython pyyaml
cd models/rfo
./rfo --help
```

Set `RFO_PYTHON` if the source launcher should use a specific Python binary.
The RF3 branch uses an RFO-specific differentiable forward pass: gradients
reach the sequence through the RF3 trunk and prediction heads, while sampled
diffusion coordinates are held constant. Standard Foundry RF3 inference is
unchanged.

## 2. Install upstream MPNN yourself

Clone [dauparas/LigandMPNN](https://github.com/dauparas/LigandMPNN). This
repository includes both ProteinMPNN and LigandMPNN inference and checkpoints;
RFO expects its `run.py` interface. The separate ProteinMPNN repository's
`protein_mpnn_run.py` interface is not compatible with this adapter.

For example, on a Linux CUDA machine, following the upstream environment setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dauparas/LigandMPNN.git /path/to/LigandMPNN
cd /path/to/LigandMPNN
conda create -n rfo-mpnn python=3.11 -y
conda activate rfo-mpnn
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
bash get_model_params.sh ./model_params

export MPNN_REPO="$(pwd)"
export MPNN_PYTHON="$(command -v python)"
export MPNN_MODEL_TYPE=protein_mpnn
"$MPNN_PYTHON" "$MPNN_REPO/run.py" --help
```

Return to the driver environment, retaining these exports. RFO invokes this
Python interpreter directly; it never imports Foundry's `mpnn` package.
The upstream requirements include specific CUDA/PyTorch versions; follow
upstream guidance if your machine needs a different CUDA build.

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `MPNN_REPO` | Absolute path to the upstream checkout containing `run.py`; required. |
| `MPNN_PYTHON` | Its environment's Python executable; defaults to the driver's Python. |
| `MPNN_MODEL_TYPE` | `protein_mpnn` (default) or `ligand_mpnn`. |
| `MPNN_CKPT` | Optional checkpoint override; must match the chosen model type. |

Default checkpoints under `$MPNN_REPO/model_params/` are
`proteinmpnn_v_48_020.pt` and `ligandmpnn_v_32_010_25.pt`, respectively.
To use ligand-aware sequence design:

```bash
export MPNN_MODEL_TYPE=ligand_mpnn
# Leave MPNN_CKPT unset to use the matching default weights.
```

Do not pass converted Foundry MPNN weights: this adapter expects upstream
weights. Old `MPNN_LEGACY_WEIGHTS` and `MPNN_CONTAINER_PYTHONPATH` settings
are not used. MPNN is required for both the RF3 and Boltz cycling branches.

RFO designs only unfixed residues in chain A and maps positional masks onto
actual PDB residue numbers and insertion codes. Standard amino acids and
complete N/CA/C/O backbone atoms are required in the designed chain. The
adapter preserves other chains and ligands from the predicted complex,
removes obsolete side-chain atoms at mutations, and selects the first sample.
When all residues are fixed, it copies the complex without calling MPNN.

## 3. Install Boltz-2

Follow the [Boltz installation instructions](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz#installation)
in a separate environment, for example:

```bash
conda create -n rfo-boltz python=3.12 -y
conda activate rfo-boltz
python -m pip install 'boltz[cuda]'
export BOLTZ_EXECUTABLE="$(command -v boltz)"
export BOLTZ_CACHE="$HOME/.cache/boltz"
"$BOLTZ_EXECUTABLE" predict --help
```

Return to the driver environment with these exports retained. Boltz downloads
its public model assets into its cache when needed. For offline execution,
prepare that cache and set `BOLTZ_CKPT` to your Boltz-2 checkpoint. RFO supplies
`--model boltz2`, `--no_kernels`, and the requested diffusion sample count.

The [Boltz prediction guide](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/blob/main/docs/prediction.md)
describes its input/MSA formats. RFO supplies `msa: empty` when no MSA is
provided, and does not send sequences to an MSA server. Set `msa_paths` in the
RFO YAML for target MSAs. Boltz is not needed with `backprop_fraction: 1.0`;
RF3 is not needed with `backprop_fraction: 0.0`.

## Optional Apptainer execution

Each model can independently run in a user-provided image by setting
`RF3_SIF`, `BOLTZ_SIF`, or `MPNN_SIF`. A model with no image configured runs
in its selected local environment. Install each model's dependencies inside
its image; there is no required shared image or `/net/software/lab/rfo` store.

```bash
export RF3_SIF=/path/to/foundry.sif
export RF3_PYTHON=python
export BOLTZ_SIF=/path/to/boltz.sif
export BOLTZ_EXECUTABLE=boltz
export MPNN_SIF=/path/to/ligandmpnn.sif
export MPNN_PYTHON=python
# MPNN_REPO still points to the host upstream checkout; RFO binds it in.
```

RFO supplies `apptainer exec --nv` and binds the source, input, output,
checkpoint and MSA paths it uses. All bound paths retain their host names.
Add comma-separated paths with `RF3_BIND_PATHS`, `BOLTZ_BIND_PATHS` or
`MPNN_BIND_PATHS` for additional resources. Bind paths must not contain commas.
RF3 forwards `RF3_CKPT`, `CCD_MIRROR_PATH`, `PDB_MIRROR_PATH`, `X3DNA`, and
`DSSP` when set. Configure these to your own resources if required by your
RF3 checkpoint's transform pipeline.

## Run and verify

From `models/rfo`, after exporting the settings above:

```bash
./rfo --config src/rfo/cycling/configs/example.yaml --total-cycles 1
```

Use `--backprop-fraction 0` and `--backprop-fraction 1` in separate output
directories to exercise each branch. The default example needs both models.
A completed run writes a records JSON and the redesigned complex under
`inputs/`. Missing MPNN installations/checkpoints fail before model inference;
failed or incomplete runs return a nonzero exit status.

The portable adapter, CLI and gradient tests can be run from the repository root:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=models/rfo/src python -m pytest models/rfo/tests
```

These tests use a stand-in external CLI and small differentiable tensors;
they do not replace a GPU smoke test with real model weights.
